# Working with Coding Assistants: Tips and Tricks

This document outlines best practices for working effectively with AI coding assistants to maximize productivity and code quality.

## Code Generation Best Practices - Do's and Don'ts

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Rely on the AI's internal knowledge. | **Provide relevant context from a known good source of truth. Provide examples!** |
| Give vaguely defined tasks and let the AI "fill in the blanks." | Work with the AI to generate requirements, design, and a task list. |
| Treat your prompt context as ephemeral, lost forever when you close your IDE's chat window. | **Treat the context you create as an asset in your repository, committed adjacent to the code its used to produce.** |
| Have long chat sessions performing multiple unrelated tasks. | **Have AI track work completed and to do, start new sessions focused on specific tasks using docs and code as context.** |
| Waste time trying to talk the AI into getting back on the right track. | **Learn to recognize when the AI has gotten off track, and take control. Checkpoints are your friend!** |
| Use settings which give the AI a lot of autonomy, especially for potentially destructive tasks. | **Be an active participant or "shoulder surfer", approving actions or changes.** |
| Accept AI-generated code without testing it. | **Always test AI-generated code thoroughly, including edge cases.** |
| Commit large AI-generated changes without review. | **Review and commit AI changes in small, logical chunks with clear commit messages.** |
| Share sensitive data (API keys, passwords, personal info) in prompts. | **Be mindful of data privacy and use placeholder values for sensitive information.** |
| Use AI for critical security or performance-sensitive code without expert review. | **Have human experts review AI-generated code for security vulnerabilities and performance implications.** |
| Expect AI to understand your entire codebase without explicit context. | **Provide relevant code snippets, documentation, and architectural context.** |

## Key Principles

1. **Context is King**: Always provide clear, relevant context and examples
2. **Collaboration Over Delegation**: Work *with* the AI, don't just give it tasks
3. **Documentation as Asset**: Save important context and decisions in your repository
4. **Stay Focused**: Keep sessions focused on specific tasks
5. **Stay in Control**: Be an active participant and approve changes
6. **Test Everything**: Never trust AI-generated code without thorough testing
7. **Security First**: Always review AI code for security vulnerabilities
8. **Version Control**: Commit AI changes in small, reviewable chunks

## Workflow Tips

- **Start Small**: Begin with simple tasks to understand the AI's capabilities
- **Iterate Quickly**: Use short feedback cycles to refine outputs
- **Break Down Complex Tasks**: Divide large features into smaller, manageable pieces
- **Use AI for Learning**: Ask the AI to explain its code and decisions
- **Keep Sessions Focused**: One task per chat session for better context management
- **Document Your Prompts**: Save successful prompts and techniques for reuse

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Over-reliance**: Don't let AI replace your critical thinking
- **Context Pollution**: Avoid mixing unrelated tasks in the same session
- **Blind Trust**: Always validate AI suggestions against your requirements
- **Security Oversights**: Be cautious with authentication, authorization, and data handling code
- **Performance Neglect**: AI may prioritize readability over performance
- **Technical Debt**: AI might choose quick solutions over long-term maintainability

# Firebase Environment Factory

Instructions for workshop team members to create pre-packaged Firebase Studio environments for participants.

## Process

### 1. Create Initial Environment
- Follow the **Option B: Firebase Studio Setup** steps from [workshop.md](./workshop.md)
- Complete the full setup process including `npm install`
- Verify the app is running successfully in the web preview

### 2. Capture Environment Link
- Go back to [Firebase Studio](https://studio.firebase.google.com/)
- Find your environment in the list
- Click the **`...` menu** next to your environment
- **Copy the link**
- Add the link as a new entry in the [Workshop Environments Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hNdpYMsJJcs7cQlCuk5BVH5JbcF_5AU7NrCH2EZO42g/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

### 3. Create Duplicates
- Use the same **`...` menu** and choose **"Duplicate"**
- Verify the duplicated environment is functional
- Add the duplicate's link to the spreadsheet
- Repeat as needed for multiple workshop sessions

### 4. Share with Joel and Gonzalo
- Use the same **`...` menu** and choose **"Share"**
- Add Joel and Gonzalo to the list
- This will allow us to assign the environments later

## Notes
- You can share environments with specific participants by email using the **`...` menu â†’ Share** option
- Each pre-packaged environment saves participants ~5-10 minutes of setup time
- Test each environment before the workshop to ensure functionality
